Hi, I am a Ph.D. student at [Interactive Robotics Lab](https://interactive-robotics.engineering.asu.edu/), Arizona State University, advised by [Prof. Heni Ben Amor](http://henibenamor.weebly.com/). My research interests include language-conditioned robot manipulation and robot perception. 

Prior to starting Ph.D., I received my M.S. at Carnegie Mellon University and B.E. at Southwest Jiaotong University. During my undergraduate period, I worked with [Prof. Xiao Wu](https://faculty.swjtu.edu.cn/wuxiao1/en/index.htm) on unsupervised image-to-image generation.
